## 📖 Project Abstract
This repository contains a modular C++ framework for solving Initial Value Problems (IVPs) of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The project was developed as part of the **CSE261 Numerical Methods** course.

The primary objective is to implement, analyze, and compare the accuracy and convergence rates of three specific numerical algorithms:
1.  **Euler's Method** (1st Order)
2.  **Heun's Method** (Modified Euler / 2nd Order)
3.  **Midpoint Method** (2nd Order)

The software exports high-precision simulation data to CSV format for external analysis and visualization.

## 🚀 Implemented Methods
We have implemented three primary single-step methods:
1.  **Euler's Method** (First-order accuracy)
2.  **Heun's Method** (Modified Euler / Predictor-Corrector)
3.  **Midpoint Method** (Runge-Kutta 2nd Order)

## ✨ Key Features
This project implements several advanced software engineering practices applied to numerical analysis:

* **Modular Architecture:** The solver logic (`NumericalMethods`), mathematical functions (`ODEFunctions`), and I/O handling (`FileWriter`) are strictly separated into different files. This allows for easy maintenance and scalability.
* **Multiple Solvers:** Implements three distinct algorithms (Euler, Heun, Midpoint) to allow for direct performance comparison.
* **Automated Error Analysis:** Automatically calculates the absolute error at every time step and computes the Global Error for varying step sizes ($h$).
* **Data Export Pipeline:** Generates structured `.csv` files for all simulation data, enabling professional plotting in tools like Excel, Python (Matplotlib), or MATLAB.
* **Configurable Physics:** The differential equation ($dy/dt$) is defined as a standalone function, allowing users to solve different problems without rewriting the core solver code.
